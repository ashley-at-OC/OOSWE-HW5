Use of Microsoft Copilot (AI):
Ran into a lot of issues trying to get Mockito framework set-up. Microsoft Copilot suggested installing Byte-Buddy and Objenesis, and installing those two worked. 
Asked Microsoft Pilot if Mockito was similar to NSubstitute (another unit testing framework I've used before), and it compared substitutes to mocks and the use of Returns() to stubs which helped.
