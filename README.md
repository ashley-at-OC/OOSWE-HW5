Use of Microsoft Copilot (AI):
Ran into issues regarding GitHub account credentials that prevented me from pushing to my OC GitHub repo.
Asked Microsoft Copilot how to switch or "log out" of my personal account, the solution that worked was to go to Credential Manager and remove the already existing account.
